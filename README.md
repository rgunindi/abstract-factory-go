# AbstractFactory Design Pattern

This project demonstrates the AbstractFactory design pattern in Golang.

The AbstractFactory design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

In this project, we have a `AbstractFactory` interface that defines the methods for creating `Chair`, `Sofa`, and `Table` objects. We also have two concrete implementations of the `AbstractFactory` interface: `ModernFactory` and `VictorianFactory`. The `ModernFactory` creates modern-style furniture, while the `VictorianFactory` creates victorian-style furniture.

To use the `AbstractFactory` pattern, you first create an instance of the desired factory. Then, you call the factory's methods to create the objects that you need.

For example, the following code creates a modern chair:


factory := modernFactory{}
chair := factory.CreateChair()


The `AbstractFactory` design pattern is a powerful tool that can be used to decouple the creation of objects from their concrete classes. This can make your code more flexible and maintainable.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure of this project is as follows:

```bash
.
├── Concreates
│   ├── modernFactory.go
│   └── victorianFactory.go
├── Interfaces
│   ├── AbstractFactory.go
│   ├── IChair.go
│   └── ISofa.go
│   └── ITable.go
├── Products
│   ├── Modern
│   │   ├── Chair.go
│   │   ├── Sofa.go
│   │   └── Table.go
│   └── Victorian
│       ├── Chair.go
│       ├── Sofa.go
│       └── Table.go
└── go.mod

```

The `Concreates` directory contains the concrete implementations of the `AbstractFactory` interface.

The `Interfaces` directory contains the interfaces for the `Chair`, `Sofa`, and `Table` objects.

The `Products` directory contains the concrete implementations of the `Chair`, `Sofa`, and `Table` objects.

The `go.mod` file is the Go module file for the project.

## How to Use

To use this project, you first need to install Golang. Once Golang is installed, you can clone the project repository to your computer.

To run the project, you can use the following command:


go run main.go
```

This will create a modern chair and a victorian chair.

You can also test the project by running the following command:

```
go test ./...
```

This will run the unit tests for the project.
